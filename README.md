# FishFood v1.0.0
##### by SSyl
This mod adds two new recipes that use fish and also makes the fishing rod and fishing bait craftable.

I felt that fishing in the game was mostly overlooked and there wasn't any real use for fishing. On top of that, depending on your world, you may not run into a merchant for a long time which makes actually getting a fishing rod pretty difficult, so I fixed that.

**Added recipes:**

**Fish Sausages:** 2 Raw Fish, 1 Dandelion, 3 Thistle. 50 HP, 50 Stamina, 1600 sec duration, 3hp/tick

**Fish Soup:** 3 Raw Fish, 2 Carrot, 1 Turnip, 2 Honey. 60 HP, 60 Stamina, 2000 sec duration, 3hp/tick

**Fishing Rod:** 5 Core Wood, 10 Fine Wood

**Fishing Bait:** 4 Resin, 1 Neck Tail
